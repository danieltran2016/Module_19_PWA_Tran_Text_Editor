## Installation
  
- npm install 
- --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
- the second command line command is one that we ran into in class with our instructor. i added to to the package json but it never installed properly in class, so i just added this CLI command and it fixed the babel. 

    
## Usage
    
The user can download the repo, run the above CLI commands, then run npm run start and the progarm will run. Conversely, it will be on heroku until the course is over Juiy 8 2023.
